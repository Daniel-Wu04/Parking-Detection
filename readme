Using the pklot data combine the three train and test files into one, using the combine script for the mega txt file. 
use image combine to create the folder of the image data sets
image process to process the images for the machine learning model so it doesnt have to recompile each run
run the parking detect linear models 

just watch for the file path logic, and making sure the file paths to the folders are correct as the txt store relative paths
